# Personal Library

<p>This project was developed in the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's Quality Assurance course</a>.</p>

<p>To complete this project I had to implement the API with the <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code> and <code>DELETE</code> methods. To do this, establish a connection with MongoDB, a NoSQL database. After that, I implemented and performed the necessary unit tests.</p>

<p>It's also available on replit: <a href="https://replit.com/@adrianwilker/project-library" target="_blank">replit.com/@adrianwilker/project-library</a>.</p>
